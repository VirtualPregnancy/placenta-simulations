Welcome to our 'Virtual Pregnancy'
==================================

Welcome to the Pregnancy Modelling team at Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland.

We are a research group that focuses on developing computational models that contribute to a `Virtual
Pregnancy`. Our group was established by Dr Alys Clark (Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland) and Dr Joanna James
(Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland)
in around 2012.

Since establishment of the group we have been grateful to receive funding from a number of sources to create the virtual pregnancy.
These funding sources include The Royal Society of New Zealand Te Aparangi via the Marsden Fund, the Catalyst Fund,
and the Rutherford Discovery Fellowship programme, the Wellcome Leap In Utero Program, The Health Research Council of New Zealand Consolidator Fund, The Gravida Centre of Research Excellence,
The Aotearoa Foundation, The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (University of Auckland), and Auckland Bioengineering Institute (University of Auckland).

We use two main in house libraries to develop our and run our models. We also use a number of other (open-source)
libraries and software to do our work, that we do not develop. Where we use these other softwares for a process we
encourage working through training and documentation for that particular software:

	1. The placentagen libraries, found `at this link <https://github.com/VirtualPregnancy/placentagen.git>`_.
	2. The reprosim libraries, found `at this link <https://github.com/VirtualPregnancy/reprosim.git>`_.

You don't need to install all the software straight away, and each example you work through will indicate what software
is needed prior to use.
